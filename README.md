Android Canvas with Generative AI (Gemini)
Project Overview
This project leverages Android's Canvas API combined with Generative AI (Gemini) to offer a unique, interactive experience for drawing and solving problems. The app allows users to draw on the canvas, generating beautiful handwritten text, solving mathematical problems, and interacting with AI to answer various questions by simply sketching or writing.

This application is designed to simplify tasks such as:

Drawing to generate text
Solving mathematical equations by drawing them
Answering queries with drawn text inputs
It aims to bring a similar experience as iOS/iPad's "Scribble" feature but for Android devices, offering users the power to interact with AI directly on the canvas.

Features
AI Text Generation: Write on the canvas and watch as the AI converts your handwriting into beautiful text.
Mathematical Problem Solver: Simply draw a mathematical equation, and the AI will provide the correct solution.
Interactive Q&A: Draw your questions on the canvas, and the AI will respond with accurate answers.
Generative AI (Gemini): Powered by Google's latest Generative AI Gemini for advanced interpretation and response capabilities.
